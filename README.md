# Decision_Tree

## Introduction

A streamlit project for better understanding Decison Trees, Use It For Learning Decision Trees Easily.

Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in developing a model. Understanding the impact of different hyperparameters can help you to enhance model performance.
The simple way to understand this is to create a streamlit app that allows you tune the hyperparameters and plot decision boundary of your model.



## **Steps To Implement This Simple Project:**

1.  Install the libraries specified in requirements.txt
   ``` python
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2.   Run the main.py
   ```python
     Streamlit run main.py
   ```
3.  Adjust the hyperparameters to see the difference in model
